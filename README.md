# About

This website serves as my resume and showcases my skills, experience, and projects. I have included a brief introduction about myself, my education, and my work history, as well as links to my social media profiles and contact information. 

Please note that this website serves as my resume and is intended to provide an overview of my skills and experience. However, I am actively working to improve the website with new features and enhancements.

## Future Improvements

Although the website currently serves as my resume and showcases my skills and experience, there are several areas where it can be improved. Here are some of the enhancements that I plan to add in the future:

* Add more detailed information about my projects and experiences
* Create a blog section to share my thoughts and ideas
* Implement a contact form for users to easily get in touch with me
* Improve the website's mobile responsiveness

## Project Status

Please note that this project is still in development and is bound to improve over time with new features and enhancements.
